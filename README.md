# Project001
C Program


In this project, user can cast their personal vote for their candidate
as they wish. One can vote for their candidate and can also do a 
couple of things. One can find the leading Candidate in the election 
in two ways. Either the voter can understand the leading candidate with
the number of votes cast for each candidate or directly it will show 
the leading candidate in the election. It deals with monitoring the 
information and transaction of votes. This mini project on Election of 
Candidates in C is compiled in Code::Blocks IDE using GCC compiler. 
It is complete and totally error-free. The source code for this project 
is only close to 100 lines.
